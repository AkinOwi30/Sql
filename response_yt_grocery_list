Question:
How to change a line with 4 items, into a grocery list (ie num, item)?

 

Free online editor I used for this example; it has the Orders table so it might save you some time using it directly:
https://www.programiz.com/sql/online-compiler/

*Pay close attention to your successful copy and paste patterns because the compiler is below is picky on formatting.

The plan:
1.	Drop all the rows/lines we won’t be using.

1a.
How to delete a row: https://github.com/AkinOwi30/Sql/blob/main/DELETE_FROM_to_delete_a_record_from_a_table

1aa. Example command:
DELETE FROM Orders
WHERE order_id ='3';


2.  Now we insert the values from the list since I don't know how to just softcode pull them in if that's even possible in sql:

**2b. It may save time to delete the extra columns before adding the data to not have to put placeholder data in soon to be deleted columns.

2a. Example insert scripts:
INSERT INTO Orders(order_id, item, amount, customer_id)
VALUES ('2', 'Sour Gummy Worms' ,'delete', '5');

--
INSERT INTO Orders(order_id, item, amount, customer_id)VALUES ('3', 'toothpaste' ,'4', '5');

INSERT INTO Orders(order_id, item, amount, customer_id)VALUES ('4', 'cereal' ,'4', '5');

3.	Now just delete the extra columns and we’re done
