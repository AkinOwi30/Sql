So the plan is to make all the new rows from the previous one, 
then drop all the columns except num and name, 
then drop all the rows that arenâ€™t the ones we made

How to delete a row: https://github.com/AkinOwi30/Sql/blob/main/DELETE_FROM_to_delete_a_record_from_a_table
here's an example:

DELETE FROM Orders
WHERE order_id ='3';

-so we delete all but our desired row that has four things we wwant a list of-
--now we insert the values from the list since I don't know how to just softcode pull them in if that's even possible in sql:
INSERT INTO Orders(order_id, item, amount, customer_id)
VALUES ('2', 'Sour Gummy Worms' ,'delete', '5');

--
INSERT INTO Orders(order_id, item, amount, customer_id)VALUES ('3', 'toothpaste' ,'4', '5');

INSERT INTO Orders(order_id, item, amount, customer_id)VALUES ('4', 'cereal' ,'4', '5');
-----------------
now time to delete the extra columns and we should be done
